<h4><strong>AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVES</strong></h4>
<p>Student librarians are exposed to the &lsquo;works&rsquo; or behind-the-scenes of a librarian&rsquo;s daily duties. These activities include the scanning of books, cataloguing and shelving of books according to the barcodes. They help to promote the love of reading and resources in our school library among their peers. Through this CCA, student librarians are given the chance to lead and plan activities for their peers and render service to the school, the teachers and their peers.</p>
