### **Brownies**

### **Aims and  Objectives**

Brownies is a uniformed group CCA for young girls in the Primary Schools. It is under Girl Guides, an educational youth movement.&nbsp; Girl Guides Singapore aims to develop young women’s fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.&nbsp; It is open to all girls without distinction of creed, race, nationality, or any other circumstance.

### **Character Development**

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Values:

For Brownies, Guiding is a&nbsp;_game_&nbsp;of adventure, of observation, of general knowledge and of ideas.&nbsp; The Brownie Law encourages every brownie to :

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obey and respect her elders

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think of others before herself

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell the truth

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be neat and tidy

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be thrifty

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;play and work cheerfully

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership Training:

As Brownies, the girls are nurtured through a 5-Point Programme, a non-formal educational programme to develop leadership, decision-making as well as life skills, in these broad areas:

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal and Social Development

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoors

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International

### **Programme &amp; Activities**

As a Brownie in Guiding, she will  
●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wear a smart uniform, work, and play in a group of her own (Six / Pack),  
●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make a promise and try to live up to it and find happiness in helping others.

### **Benefits**

They play the game through a series of healthy and happy activities, which becomes an educational course that teaches them how to lead a useful life.
