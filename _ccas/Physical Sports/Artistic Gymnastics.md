<h5><strong>AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVES</strong></h5>
<p>Artistic Gymnastics is a discipline of gymnastics which aims to condition the body while enhancing the cognitive aspects as well as the physical and coordination skills of the gymnast. In addition, the sport also develops the gymnast psychologically and socially while interacting and working with other gymnasts.</p>

<h5><strong>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT</strong></h5>
<p>Through gymnastics, our young athletes learn the importance of teamwork, sportsmanship, and fair play. Gymnastics is difficult to perform, and it requires a lot of dedication and time for our gymnasts to attain mastery of the fundamental skills. As our gymnasts work towards their goals, they develop patience and perseverance.</p>

<h5><strong>PROGRAMME &amp; ACTIVITIES</strong></h5>
<p><p>Artistic Gymnastics is a dynamic sport where gymnasts complete short routines on equipment specially designed for the sport. The game is known for its artistry and grace, requiring gymnasts to display exceptional strength, balance and flexibility while doing somersaults, flips and other acrobatic moves.Â  Gymnasts must possess psychological qualities such as the courage to attempt difficult moves and the discipline to practise a routine many times. The three events we compete in include Uneven Bars, Balance Beam and Floor Exercise. This is a competitive sport CCA. Attendance, commitment, and sustained performance are required from all CCA members.</p>
