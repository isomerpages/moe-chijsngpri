### **Introduction**&nbsp;
<p>Rhythmic Gymnastics&nbsp;is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation. It develops graceful movement, flexibility, coordination, and dance moves combined with hand apparatus. &nbsp;Hand apparatus include&nbsp;rope, hoop, ball, clubs, and ribbon. Rhythmic Gymnasts can be performed individually or in a group.</p>

### **Aims and Objectives**&nbsp;
<p>Rhythmic Gymnastics as a CCA&nbsp;when started young, aims to prevent undesirable developments and habits related to the body structure, at the same time, enhances the cognitive aspects as well as the physical/coordination skills of the gymnast. As a gymnast grows, she will continue to develop, extend, and refine agility, balance, coordination and flexibility which are required for higher level skills. Progressively, she will learn and develop the fundamental and higher-level gymnastics skills needed for competition. Also, she will be required to handle hand apparatus, which ensures progressive participation in competitive gymnastics.&nbsp;  
  
Gymnastics is a sport of learning a skill and then practising it to perfection. With intentional and dedicated practice of the sport, the values of self-discipline and perseverance are developed.</p>

### **Character Development**&nbsp;

We hope to develop the following values through gymnastics:  
&nbsp;🙘 Respect  
&nbsp;🙘 Self-discipline  
&nbsp;🙘 Perseverance  
&nbsp;🙘 Patience  
&nbsp;🙘 Self-confidence  
&nbsp;🙘 Time-management

Gymnastics provides opportunities to develop skills in communication and team building. In a team, pupils learn to treat others with respect. These skills enable a pupil to function effectively as leaders, as well. Such leadership skills are further honed when they carry out pupil-initiated projects/events or lead during CCA Camp and Leadership Camp.

### **Programmes/Activities**&nbsp;

How Do I Qualify for the CCA Programme?

1\. Selection and trial training module at Primary One

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils with potential will be identified during one of the Physical Education lessons at Primary One while pupils of other levels (P3-P4) will have to wait for the CCA recruitment drive (at P3) or transfer period in January.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified pupils will be invited to attend a two week gymnastics trial.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon confirmation, the pupil will officially join the gymnastics team as a CCA and has to stay committed to the sports.

Note: Shortlisted pupils will receive consent forms issued through Parent Gateway.&nbsp;
