##### **STEM-based Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**<br>**Environmental Science and Sustainability**
  
##### **Approach**

The Applied Learning Programme is an initiative by the Ministry of Education to enhance pupils’ educational experience and provide the opportunity for pupils to see the usefulness of their learning in the real world. It aims to nurture innovation and creativity to prepare our children for the future.

SNGS’s ALP programme – Maker’s Fantasy - Innovations in Maths &amp; Science for a Sustainable Earth, aims to inculcate in our pupils the 21st Century Competencies through learning experiences in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and its real-life application to solve problems.

In line with the ALP-STEM theme of Sustaining the Earth, efforts are made to reduce unnecessary waste and our use of natural resources in order to protect the earth.

The activities and learning experiences are centred around the theme of Sustainable Earth, with a distinctive flavour of leveraging on technology for pupils to explore technology-related solutions to address real-world problems. Under the ALP, we adopted Makers’ Education as an approach to provide pupils with hands-on learning and building experiences. These activities encourage them to identify, create and apply their learning to solve problems.

Examples of the activities include:  

*   Use of Strawbees for prototyping
*   P3 Maths &amp; Science Learning Trail
*   P3 Science Project: Animal Diorama using recyclables
*   Performance Based Tasks ( “Madagascar Rescue!” and “Let there be light!” etc )
*   Toy-making project using recyclables
*   Waste Management and Food Sustainability ( The Study of Black Soldier Fly )
*   P5 Coding ( Renewable Energy Sources )
*   P4 My Eco-garden (Maths)
*   P3 My Dream Room (Maths)
