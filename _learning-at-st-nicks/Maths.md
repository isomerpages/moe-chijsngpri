<p><strong>Vision</strong><br />A reflective learner, An effective problem solver, A skilful communicator</p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong><br />Develop every St Nick girl to be a self-directed learner, to be able to think critically and solve problems creatively,</p>
<p><strong>Our Signature Programme</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RICE (Reasoning, Inquiry, Communication and Engagement)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To develop our girls to be a learner with effective problem skills and a skillful communicator, the department has different activities for P1 &ndash; P6 girls. The activities are inquiry based and engaging with the use of technology. Through these activities, our girls need to explore, be more self- directed in their learning as well as to learn collaboratively. This also gives our girls the opportunity to develop their reasoning and communication skills.</p>
