<p><strong>Vision</strong><br />Every pupil able to apply scientific knowledge and skills to appreciate and care for the natural world. Every pupil able to apply scientific knowledge and skills to appreciate and care for the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>Approach<br /></strong>SNGS science curriculum deploys the inquiry approach to provide student-centric learning experiences to nurture our pupils to become lifelong learners, and to maintain a sense of wonder about the world around them. The department hopes to foster science-related attitudes, skills and knowledge pupils need to develop inquiry, problem-solving, and decision-making abilities. These skills help them to acquire new knowledge and solve problems in a creative manner, so that they may improve the quality of their own lives and the lives of others.</p>
<p><strong>Our Signature Programmes<br />STEM-based Applied Learning Programme (ALP)<br />Environmental Science and Sustainability</strong></p>
<p><strong>Objective of ALP:</strong><br />The ALP is designed with the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>To nurture and develop students who will care deeply for the environment and are change agents in contributing to environmental sustainability.</li>
<li>To develop the necessary skills and values for the 21st century competencies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Makerspace@P3sngs</strong>&nbsp;is developed and implemented for students to apply the simplified&nbsp;<strong>Design Thinking (DT)&nbsp;</strong>process to bring their ideas to life. Students learn to&nbsp;<strong>Ask</strong>&nbsp;relevant questions to understand a given problem,&nbsp;<strong>Brainstorm</strong>&nbsp;on various solutions to solve the problem,&nbsp;<strong>Plan</strong>&nbsp;the steps needed to take,&nbsp;<strong>Create</strong>&nbsp;a prototype to test out the solution, and lastly,&nbsp;<strong>Improve</strong>&nbsp;on the prototype if necessary. As students go through this SNGS Thinking Cycle in the tasks set for them, they pick up new skills and are given opportunities to showcase their creativity and aptitude for Science through our school-based programme.</p>
<p>Part of the ALP also involves implementing&nbsp;<strong>Visible Thinking Routines</strong>&nbsp;to explicitly teach students how to think critically and invently and apply these skills to their day-to-day learning. When thinking is visible in classrooms, students are in a position to be more metacognitive, to think about their own thinking. When thinking is visible, it becomes clear that lessons are not about memorizing content but exploring ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Visible Thinking Routines</strong>&nbsp;in the Science curriculum aim to deepen students&rsquo; comprehension. We have divided selected &ldquo;thinking routines&rdquo; into three categories:</p>
<p>1. Routines for Introducing and Exploring Ideas<br />2. Routines for Synthesizing and Organizing Ideas<br />3. Routines for Digging Deeper into Ideas<br />By categorizing these thinking routines, students can quickly learn to apply to different context on a daily basis.</p>
