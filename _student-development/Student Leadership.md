##### **Overview**

The leadership development programme in CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (SNGS) is a vehicle which the school implements for the benefit of its pupils. It is founded on the spirit of the school’s motto, mission and vision.  
  
Guided by these fundamentals, our leadership programme seeks to nurture leaders who are committed to excellence in everything they do. We also pride ourselves with the leadership brand that is distinguished by the pertinent characteristic of leadership excellence from the viewpoint of the disadvantaged, for the benefit of the community. The programme aims to provide pupils with the platform to realise their leadership potential as they develop their skills and graduate from the programme.

The school desires every pupil who is part of the SNG community to undergo the leadership programme and grow because of it. It is a platform by which pupils develop their latent leadership qualities. They are equipped with key leadership skills and there are meaningful platforms to enact their learning.

##### **Our Programme**

  
Our leadership development programme is based on two principal provisions, the provision of ‘Training’ and ‘Opportunities’.  
  
Drawing on J.C. Maxwell’s Leadership Model, the programme progressively introduces pupils to Maxwell’s Five Levels of Leadership. This programme will help them to understand leadership as influence, as well as to equip them with skills on how they can move up the levels of influence to become better leaders. This programme is also geared towards equipping and polishing the key leadership skills and inculcating the school’s values required for pupils to exercise their leadership qualities and skills with excellence, and in which are characterised as being Christ-centered.  

For pupils to have practical and purposeful application of the latent qualities and the training they receive, the school provides opportunities for all pupils and at all levels, each distinguished by their immediate context and complexity, towards the purpose of the development of the pupil herself, and also for the benefit of the school community and community at large. 

Every pupil will undergo the prescribed leadership training. For pupils, who have displayed their talents and strengths in this area, further training will be given to develop their leadership skills laterally and in depth. In line with the school’s mission and vision, we seek to ensure that pupils who are role models and responsible are given further opportunities to excel.

With each successful implementation of the development programme, each pupil will be equipped with the necessary skills to effect changes to the benefit of those around her. Through the various strata of leadership development trainings and opportunities, the school community will benefit not only itself, but also the community at large, thereby fulfilling the school’s mission via the school’s vision.
