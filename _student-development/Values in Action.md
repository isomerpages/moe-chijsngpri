<h4><strong>Our VIA Programme:</strong></h4>
<p>The school&rsquo;s VIA is designed based on one of our school virtues, &lsquo;Learning from Life&rsquo;&nbsp;(&lsquo;活学巧用&rsquo;). It starts with developing oneself at the lower primary, extending to service to&nbsp;the school and then to the community at the upper Primary levels.</p>
