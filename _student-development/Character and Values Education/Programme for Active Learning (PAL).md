PAL @ St Nicks is a 2-year programme for all Primary 1 and 2 pupils. Pupils are exposed to PAL modules in four domains – Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. The aim of PAL is to develop well-rounded pupils in the five learning domains and help pupils develop social-emotional competencies. This year, the motto for PAL is FUN – making new Friends, Understand self and others and learn New things. Pupils are given the space within PAL to explore and apply the skills, concepts and ideas to a new situation. This lets the pupils deepen their learning, make new connections to the previous skills and knowledge and make new self-discovery.
  
PAL modules are experiential in nature and incorporate learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way. Through the modules, pupils learn more about themselves and gain greater awareness of the environment around them. They were given many opportunities to work in pairs and groups and this gave rise to greater cooperation and communication amongst the pupils.

In Primary 1, pupils learn about their new school environment through orienteering and map reading. They also learn to explore trails and work together in teams. They have the chance to create games in the Sports and Games module and discover the importance of working together in the parachute games. Through this process, they learn more about themselves and their friends.

In Primary 2, the pupils get behind the camera in the Outdoor Education module to explore the Science Garden. They learn to see nature through the camera lens and have the opportunity to learn about conservation. The pupils also learn self-expression through performing arts in Dance. They have a lot of fun learning new dance moves like Jazz, Indian dance and performing for one another. Through this module, the pupils have more stage awareness and learn how to behave as a member of the audience.
