##### **Overview**

Values are at the core of one’s character. Being an IJ school, we are guided by the values of Truth, Justice, Freedom and Love and the school motto "Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty" to help pupils realise the vision of being Girls of Grace, Women of Strength and Leaders with Heart. 

The Values Education curriculum helps to nurture in our pupils our shared societal and national values, and equip them with civic values – such as appreciation of diversity, cultural sensitivity, empathy towards others, respect for others’ perspectives, and a commitment to the common good – which are crucial in preparing our pupils to meet the challenges of a changing global world and for the functioning of society.

##### **Programmes**

**1.    School Quality Lessons – Kindness, Honesty, Responsibility, Humility and Resilience**

These five qualities are aligned to the six CCE qualities in MOE’s 21st Century Competencies framework.  Pupils who best exemplify these qualities in their behaviours and conduct will be nominated and recognised in the bi-monthly St Nicks Star Award.  Primary 4 pupils will put up class performances during Assembly period based on these five St Nicks Star qualities.

**2.         “Di Zi Gui” 《弟子规》Programme**

It aims to inculcate moral values, emphasising on, filial piety, discipline and respect for others.  Besides learning and reciting this text in the classrooms, pupils also recite them during our twice-weekly assemblies. Through reciting the text, pupils are reminded of the importance of respect, discipline, empathy and filial piety.  Pupils are also encouraged to assess their understanding of the “Di Zi Gui” verses using the self-evaluation form in their school diaries.

**3.         IJ and Schools’ History and Ethos**

Lessons and narratives on the CHIJ schools and St Nicks’ history and ethos are infused in the School Quality Lessons, Bible Time & Values Education, as well as during assemblies and school events.

**4.         Bible Time & Values Education**

Pupils who are Catholic attend Bible Time lessons.  It aims to nurture pupils' love for God through encounters with His word.  These sessions also help the pupils learn more about the Catholic faith.  For non-Catholic pupils, they will attend Values Education lessons which consist of stories from the Bible as well as fables and other stories with moral values. The life stories of Father Barré, our Founder, as well as the IJ mission will also be shared during these lessons.

**5.         Gratitude Moments**

To nurture a deep sense of gratitude amongst the pupils, pupils are given termly themes to pen down one thing they are grateful for. These themes extend from family to school and nation. Each term, a special individual or organisation is identified for pupils to pen a special thank you note to express their appreciation for their contributions.  There is a special 4-day Week of Reflection centred around the theme “Gratitude” prepared by the Chaplaincy Team for the P6 graduating pupils. It aims to encourage pupils to show gratitude to the important people in their lives as well as to show their appreciation to them.
