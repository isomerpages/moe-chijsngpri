<h4><strong>Reflection: ALPS Journal</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>ALPS Journal&nbsp;</strong> has been introduced in 2013 to cultivate the habit of reflection and to motivate individuals to build, bridge and extend their own experiences, and apply them in their everyday life. With each <strong>A&nbsp;</strong>ccount of an event or incident described, pupils will reflect on the <strong>L&nbsp;</strong>earning <strong>P&nbsp;</strong>oints and consider what their next <strong>S&nbsp;</strong>tep or course of action will be.</p>

<h4><strong>Values:《弟子规》</strong></h4>
<p>Our &ldquo;Di Zi Gui&rdquo; programme, introduced since 2009, aims to inculcate moral values, emphasizing on, filial piety, discipline and respect for others. Besides learning and reciting this text in the classrooms, pupils also recite them during our twice-weekly assemblies, with &ldquo;Di Zi Gui&rdquo; ambassadors from each class who is taking turns to lead the school in the recitation. Through reciting the text, pupils are reminded of the importance of respect, discipline, empathy and filial piety. Pupils are also encouraged to assess their understanding of the &ldquo;Di Zi Gui&rdquo; verses using the self-evaluation form in their school diaries.</p>
<p>为了提高学生的品格修养，我校于2009年推展《弟子规》校本课程。这是由我校资深教师何若锦博士设计的。目的在于培养学生高尚的品德和帮助她们养成良好的生活习惯。此外，各班将委任五位学生担任《弟子规》大使，轮流在周会之前带领同学齐声朗读。学生边读边记，提醒自己要做到自爱、自重、自律、爱人如己、爱家人、爱周围的人。同时，学生也将利用《弟子规》评估表进行自我评估，时时警惕自己，存好心，说好话，行好事，做好人。</p>
<h4><strong>Building Relationships</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restorative Practices (RP)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RP is a value&ndash;based and needs&ndash;led approach as part of a broader culture that identifies strong, mutually respectful relationships and a cohesive community as the foundations on which good teaching and learning can flourish. In such a school community, pupils are given responsibility for decision-making on issues that affect their lives, their learning and their experience of school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RP has formed the basis of our school&rsquo;s philosophy in strengthening our disciplinary processes and in building relationships in school. It has offered us an alternative way of thinking about addressing discipline and behavioural issues and offers a consistent framework for responding to these issues. This framework is based on sound learning theory regarding how people relate to each other and how best to meet the different needs that can arise from conflict or harm.</p>
<p>Beyond its role as a &lsquo;behaviour management tool&rsquo; in school, RP can also be applied in the wider range of contexts of our interactions, where we hold relationships with our families, friends and our community. It is our hope for our school community to adopt RP as a way of life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class Contact Time - RP Circle Time, 1-1 Interaction Time</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In our school, we conduct some of our CCT sessions with the Circle Time approach. Circle Time is a pedagogical tool from the Relational Teaching Framework which is used to deliver the formal curriculum. As a structured, distinctive and creative form of group work, pupils and the group facilitator (teacher) physically sit in a circle. By doing so, it helps to create a safe and non-threatening environment to everyone to speak, listen, share thoughts, explore ideas and interact. In this way, pupils' confidence and esteem will be built Circles also build relationships where all individuals involved are valued and able to learn more about themselves. Integrating the use of Circle Time in our lessons is a part of our whole school approach towards RP. With RP and Circles, we want pupils to develop emotionally and socially, and be more confident communicators.</p>
<p>In 2015, a new structure named W.E.F.I. has been introduced for our 1-1 Interaction Time. In this structure, we seek to create a more meaningful platform to allow our teachers (FT and Co-FT) to get to build positive Teacher-Student Relationship in an engaging and interactive manner. In this platform, our Year-Heads are given the autonomy to conduct level-specific activities to build greater cohesion among the level.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Assembly Programmes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A myriad of interactive and entertaining programmes with different academic and co-curricular objectives are presented for our pupils. The vibrant Assembly programmes include talks on eye care and Cyber Wellness issues, a sharing by art educators from the National Gallery Singapore and Principal&rsquo;s talks. In addition, with the facilitation of Form and Co-Form teachers, Primary 4 and Primary 5 pupils will put up class performances based on the five St Nicks Star qualities.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Counselling</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides our School Counsellor, we have Teacher Counsellors who will respond to pupils who need assistance. The Pastoral Care Room and Quiet Room are specially created for pupils to drop in during their breaks. They can do quiet yet fun activities in the room. Teacher Counsellors, Catholic Parents and Sister Theresa take turns to be at the respective rooms during recess. Pupils are encouraged to drop in for a chat.</p>
<p>Supportive peer relationships can contribute to and strengthen a caring school culture. The CHEER model provides simple steps for peers to provide support for their classmates:</p>
