<h4><strong>Character and Citizenship Education Lessons / 好品格好公民</strong></h4>
<p>In CCE lessons, pupils will learn six core values (respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care and harmony), develop SEL competencies, civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills.</p>
<p>In addition, the Family Time component in P1 and P2 CCE lessons focuses on three aspects &lsquo;ABC&rsquo;: Active Dialogue, Bonding Time and Continuous Feedback. Parents are encouraged to have regular conversations on relevant topics with their children to reinforce the learning points, to do activities recommended in the CCE Activity Book with their children and spend quality bonding time with their children. Words of encouragement can also be given by parents through the CCE Activity Book to motivate children to improve in their behaviour.</p>
