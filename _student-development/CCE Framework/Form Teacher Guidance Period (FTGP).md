<p>As Form Teachers play a central role in shaping the development of their young charges, the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) has been introduced in all primary schools since 2012. &nbsp;The allocated 45 minutes per week carves out time for more quality teacher-student interaction, and allows teachers to equip pupils with social and emotional competencies. &nbsp;During FTGP, play activities are facilitated by the form and co-form teachers to build a safe classroom environment for pupils and to enhance bonding between form teacher and pupils. &nbsp;There will also be teaching of social and emotional learning (SEL) skills as well as cyber wellness education. &nbsp;From Primary 4 onwards, modules in education and career guidance are also introduced.</p>
