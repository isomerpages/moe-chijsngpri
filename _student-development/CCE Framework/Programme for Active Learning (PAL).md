<p>In 2009, the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) committee recommended ways to raise the quality of primary education. A key aim of the recommendation is to achieve greater balance between the acquisition of knowledge and the development of skills and values to better prepare our children to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised future.</p>
<p>PAL @ St Nicks is a 2-year programme for all Primary 1 and 2 pupils. It provides our pupils with broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities in:</p>
<p>i) Sports and Games &amp; Outdoor Education,<br />ii) Performing Arts (Music and Dance) &amp; Visual Arts</p>
<p>Through these modules, our pupils develop social and emotional competencies in the five learning domains (cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical).</p>
<p>PAL is taught through the theme &lsquo;The Wonder of Nature&rsquo;. Pupils learn to appreciate and conserve the environment through hands-on exploratory activities. The experiential activities incorporate learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way. Through the modules, pupils learn more about themselves and gain greater awareness of the environment around them. Opportunities are created to allow our pupils to work in pairs and groups and this promotes greater cooperation and communication amongst the pupils.</p>
<p>The motto for PAL is FUN &ndash; making new Friends, Understand self and others and learn New things. Pupils are given the space within PAL to explore and apply the skills, concepts and ideas to a new situation. This lets the pupils deepen their learning, make new connections to the previous skills and knowledge and make new self-discovery.</p>
